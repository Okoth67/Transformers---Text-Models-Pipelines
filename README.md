# Hugging Face Transformers Pipelines Notes

This notebook contains my personal notes while studying the [Hugging Face Transformers Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/3?fw=pt).  

The focus is on exploring the **`pipeline`** function from the `transformers` library, with practical examples covering:  
- Zero-Shot Classification  
- Text Generation  
- Mask Filling  
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
- Question Answering  
- Summarization  
- Translation  

The notebook is mainly for learning and reference purposes, summarizing key concepts and hands-on practice with Hugging Face pipelines.
